Here you take your notes

Client-Server Model

Client à They start the communication by sending a request to the Server. The server sends a response to the Client.
Depending on the request sent by the client the server will send a response adequate to that request.

If there are no clients, the server just waits, if there is no server the request won’t be completed.
FIRST EXECUTE THE SERVER!!!

These programs are running on a computer (mobile, tablet…any device with a microprocessor that is able to read codes is
called a computer.)

One computer can have both the server and the client, they don’t necessarily need to be on different computers.

Computers are grouped in networks, with the IP address (something all computers have if they are connected to internet.
Also called Network interface.) The IP can change depending on the computer where you are connected.

*My phone IP address today at URJC is:

    10.0.48.186

*Teacher’s IP:

    212.128.253.64

In terminal, if you write the command ifconfig it’ll give you your IP right after the word inet.

*My computer’s IP:

    212.128.253.72

With the command ping we make sure the machine is working. The time it tells is the time it takes the signal to arrive.

*Ping time to 8.8.8.8    time=3.56ms
* Ping time to my computer   time=0.061ms (61 us)(us=microseconds)
* Ping time to my classmate’s computer   time=0.344ms (344 us)

Depending on the time, it is possible to know if the computer is near or far.
* Ping time to my mobile phone   time=5.01ms

Since an IP is a really difficult thing to remember we identify by URLàidentifying a computer’s interface for humans!!!
* Ping time to www.google.com     216.58.211.228
*Ping to www.urjc.es     212.128.240.50

You also need a PORT to connect to a server.
